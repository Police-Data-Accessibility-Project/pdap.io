      <p>
        The Police Data Access Point is published by the Police Data
        Accessibility Project, a U.S. nonprofit headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA.
        We have paid staff and volunteers from around the United States and
        beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        In every state, county, and locality, there is a network of people
        dedicated to understanding the criminal legal system using data. This is
        our community. We are a
        <strong>national project with a local focus.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people find this project when they go looking for data, and come up
        short. Our community includes data users and publishers, as well as
        anyone impacted by policing: residents, journalists, activists,
        researchers, and municipal employees.

        non-profit organization, created proofs of concept, and kept the lights
        on in moments of uncertainty.

      <h3>What makes you experts?</h3>
      <p>
        We have done thousands of hours of user research with people who use
        police data. If you have feedback to share, email
        <a href="mailto:contact@pdap.io">contact@pdap.io.</a>
      </p>
      <h3>
        What kind of data do you collect?
        <br />
      </h3>
      <p>
        Anything published by or about a criminal legal system agency: courts,
        jails, and law enforcement (police). You can read more about
        <a
          href="https://docs.pdap.io/activities/data-sources/what-is-a-data-source"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">
          what a Data Source is
        </a>
        in our docs.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not creating a massive, interoperable database. This is a defense
        mechanism against aggregating data about criminalized people.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Who is this data for?
        <br />
      </h3>
      <p>
        Everybody! Public records are for all of us. We are only interested in
        solutions which could survive the collapse of our organization. Our work
        is open-source, and our planning is transparent.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why are you different from police watchdog groups?
        <br />
      </h3>
      <p>
        Our activism is data collection and accessibility. We document systems,
        not "bad apples."
      </p>
      <h3>Is this legal?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. We're consolidating public information, in accordance with
        <a
          href="https://docs.pdap.io/meta/operations/legal"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">
          established legal precedents.
        </a>
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3>
        Are you affiliated with a political party?
        <br />
      </h3>
      <p>
        No. Our only motivation is to provide better access to public records in
        an age of disinformation. Our members have diverse perspectives and
        goals for police institutions, but we are united by the common goal of
        transparency.
